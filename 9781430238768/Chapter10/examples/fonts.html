      <h1>Stay away from the gamma ray!</h1>
      <p>Shielding from gamma rays requires large amounts of mass, in contrast
      to alpha particles which can be blocked by paper or skin, and beta particles
      which can be shielded by foil. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials
      with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is
      important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray.</p>
