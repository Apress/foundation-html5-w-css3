      <p>Having foiled a jewelry store heist on my way to receive a
      medal from the President, imagine my embarrassment to notice
      a nasty laser burn on my cape. There was no time to fly back to
      base and change into my spare costume, even at my speed. Thank
      goodness for Power Outfitters! They had my size and style in stock,
      in just the right shade of red, and at a great price, too. I went
      back after the ceremony and bought five more capes, plus matching
      gauntlets!</p>
