      <p>Power Outfitters Superhero Costume and Supply Company is
      located in a nondescript building on Kirby Ave, a site that
      once housed a large printing plant. Behind their modest
      storefront is an expansive warehouse positively packed to
      the portholes with paraphernalia.</p>

      <aside>
       <p>The historic building at 616 Kirby Ave was the former
       headquarters of Sinnott Inkworks, a leading printer of
       comic books in America since 1956.</p>
