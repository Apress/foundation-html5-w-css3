    <p>After several hours trying to determine why the loom wasn’t
    powering up, we finally read the instruction manual:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Before initializing the fluxomolecular extrusion loom,
      ensure that all interlocks are active and dynatherms are
      properly connected. You may need to <mark>step on the primary
      samoflange several times</mark> before it engages.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The samoflange was the source of our trouble. Unfortunately,
    none of us even knew what a “samoflange” was.</p>
