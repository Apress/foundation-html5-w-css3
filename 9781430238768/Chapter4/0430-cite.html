    <p>Famed reporter <cite>Norm Deplume</cite> had this to say about
    our shop:</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://example.com/gadgets/PowerOutfitters/">
      <p>Power Outfitters Superhero Costume and Supply Company is
      located in a nondescript building on Kirby Ave, a site that
      once housed a large printing plant. Behind their modest
      storefront is an expansive warehouse positively packed to
      the portholes with paraphernalia.</p>
