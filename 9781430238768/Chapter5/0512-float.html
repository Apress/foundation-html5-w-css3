    Having foiled a jewelry store heist on my way to receive a
    medal from the President, imagine my embarrassment to notice
    a nasty laser burn on my cape. There was no time to fly back to
    base and change into my spare costume, even at my speed. Thank
    goodness for Power Outfitters! They had my size and style in stock,
    in just the right shade of red, and at a great price, too. I went
    back after the ceremony and bought five more capes, plus matching
    gauntlets!</p>

      <p>Power Outfitters Superhero Costume and Supply Company is located
      in a nondescript building on Kirby Ave, a site that once housed a
      large printing plant. Behind their modest storefront is an expansive
      warehouse positively packed to the portholes with paraphernalia.</p>

      <p>You can find all the standard costume components and accessories,
      both off the rack and custom tailored. Capes, cowls, tights, belts,
      boots, and of course masks in every shape and style. But what youâ€™ll
      also find at Power Outfitters is some of the most astounding
      super-science gadgetry ever conceived on this planet, or several others.
      I was lucky enough to receive a tour of the manufacturing wing to see
      what goes into making some of their top selling items.</p>
