      <p>Power Outfitters Superhero Costume and Supply Company is located in a
      nondescript building on Kirby Ave, a site that once housed a large printing
      plant. Behind their modest storefront is an expansive warehouse positively
      packed to the portholes with paraphernalia.</p>

      <p>You can find all the standard costume components and accessories, both off
      the rack and custom tailored. Capes, cowls, tights, belts, boots, and of
      course masks in every shape and style. But what youâ€™ll also find at Power
      Outfitters is some of the most astounding super-science gadgetry ever conceived
      on this planet, or several others. I was lucky enough to receive a tour of the
      manufacturing wing to see what goes into making some of their top selling items.</p>

      <p>At dawn on the day of my tour, an hour when many of our readers are just
      returning to their various lairs after a long night patrolling the city's rooftops,
      I arrived at the Power Outfitters loading dock. Amanda Simonson, VP of Research
      and Development, was there to greet me, disturbingly chipper for such an early
      hour before I'd finished my first cup of coffee. &ldquo;Believe me, you'll
      want to be here when we power up The Loom for the day,&rdquo; she had told
      me over the phone. &ldquo;It's pretty amazing the first time you see it.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The Loom&rdquo; is a <b>fluxomolecular extrusion loom</b>, one of only
      three in the world. It was developed by the esteemed Dr. Richards in the late
      60s, and it really is a sight to behold. The Loom breaks down recycled matter &mdash;
      on this day it was a truckload of old tires, but any matter will do &mdash; into
      its base atoms.</p>

      <p>Through a complicated and closely guarded top secret fusion process, those
      atoms are reconstituted and smashed together to form <b>unstable molecules</b>.
      The molecules are in turn linked into chains, the chains coiled into threads,
      and the threads woven into a truly remarkable costuming material. Through slight
      alterations of the composition of the matrix and chirality of the molecules, the
      resulting fabric can have an astonishing range of unique properties.</p>

      <p>The fabric can stretch and flex to ridiculous degrees without tearing, is nearly
      frictionless, waterproof when it needs to be, insulated against electricity and
      magnetic fields, refuses to burn even at solar temperatures, repels acids and
      corrosives like an oiled duck, and can even be made nearly invisible by tweaking
      its light refraction index. It takes a cobalt laser to cut the stuff, and the
      garments aren't so much stitched together as they are welded together at a
      subatomic level.</p>

      <p>The Loom's fusion chamber is a round void less than an inch in diameter,
      but housed at the heart of a spherical shell nearly 11 feet thick to withstand
      the intense, exotic energies within. It looks like a pair of 20 foot stainless
      steel salad bowls joined together lip to lip, with masses of tubes and cables
      spilling like entrails from the equator.</p>

      <p>And when they flip the giant power switch and the thing hums and rumbles to
      life&hellip; well, it was certainly worth getting up in the wee hours to see a
      show like that. The engineers at Power Outfitters recreate the Big Bang in miniature
      scale every weekday morning at 6:30am. It turns out you have to create a tiny
      universe if you want to make a really durable leotard.</p>
